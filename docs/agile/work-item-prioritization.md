# Work Item Prioritization

Order of priority in determining which items to work on (and try to complete) first:

1. Hybrid Production Hotfix items (most recent release)
1. Hybrid current release User Stories and Defects
1. Hybrid current release production Bugs (Priority 1-3 only)
1. Hybrid next release User Stories (typically the next month)
1. Hybrid next release Bugs (typically the next month)
1. Web X Emergent Work
1. Priority 4 Bugs

If you have multiple items within the same priority tier, refer to the Severity or Priority on the work item. As usual, if you are still uncertain, you should ask Justin, Seth, myself or Matt.
