# Daily Standup

Daily Standup’s are Team meetings. These meetings are designed to quickly report status and for the team to hold one another accountable to updates regarding work the team committed to in pursuit of the current Sprint goal. This is a meeting for the team to hold one another accountable and to assist with achieving the Sprint goal. Stick to the meetings intent.

## Three Questions

Team members MUST proactively answer the following 3 questions only:

1. What did I work on yesterday?
1. What do I plan on working on today?
1. What are my impediments (if any)?

    **(pick the next team member to give their update)**

## Guidelines

Here are some other guidelines to hold one another accountable to staying on target:

- **Be prepared with your updates** to the 3 questions and give your update when you are ready (no assigned order)
- **Developer dashboards may be for visibility/context ONLY**, stick to the 3 questions above, and mention ticket #'s as needed
- **Use the phrase “…and other stuff”** if you worked on tasks unrelated Sprint (like an interview, a task unrelated to the Sprint from leadership, etc.).  
- **Say “Elmo”** if someone rambles or strays to indicate to all of us “Enough, Let’s Move On.”
- **Say “impediments”, not “blockers”**, to indicate your progress is impeded and you need help from the Team or others to progress on the Sprint Goal
- **Do not elaborate on impediments** in the Daily Standup, the Scrum Master will track and they will be addressed in the Daily Sitdown or separate meetings - or feel free to reach out to needed Team members as needed.
